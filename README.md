# Ramjet-Sega-Model-2-Emulator-Mods

These mods are my original for the Sega Model 2 emulator back in 2012... 
- M2Borderless V0.7 allowed off screen reloading in lightgun shooter games (virtua cop etc)
- RamjetVR V1.4 was a PacDrive LED controller compatible emulator for the lights on a Sega cabinet.

Just popping these on github as other places I had uploaded 10 years ago have apparently pulled down the files finally lol.... 

FYI also, after I made these mods. I worked with Howard_Casto to integrate this into his tools also. I think Troubleshooter2 ended up with the same functionality.

My mods are simply Autohotkey scripts that read data from a txt file the emulator creates and updates from status registers in the running game for the IO bits that would normally be sent to the hardware board in the original machine for controlling lights on/off etc...  It's nothing amazing but it worked at the time and pretty sure model 3 ended up following the same kind of memread functionality to do the same thing.

It was a fun project.
